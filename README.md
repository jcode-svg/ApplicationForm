# ApplicationForm
A practice project

Below is a short written explanation of the updates made:

Clean Architecture: Implemented a structured architecture consisting of API, Domain, Infrastructure, Application, and Shared Kernel layers to promote separation of concerns, maintainability, and testability.

Layered Approach: Each layer serves a specific purpose:

API Layer: Handles incoming requests and serves as the entry point to the application.
Domain Layer: Contains entities representing core concepts of the application.
Infrastructure Layer: Provides implementations for external dependencies such as databases.
Application Layer: Acts as an intermediary between the API and Domain layers.
Shared Kernel: Contains shared components and utilities used across multiple layers, reducing duplication.

Decoupled Database: Utilized Cosmos NoSQL DB with loose coupling, enabling seamless swapping of the database type without significant code changes, enhancing flexibility and scalability.

Unit Testing: Implemented unit tests using XUnit to ensure the correctness of service methods, promoting code reliability and facilitating future refactoring or enhancements.

Exception Handling Middleware: Integrated middleware to globally handle exceptions, ensuring consistent error handling across the application and improving reliability.

Attribute Validation: Employed attribute-based validation to validate client inputs, enhancing data integrity and security by preventing invalid data from entering the system.

Dependency Injection: Leveraged dependency injection to manage component dependencies, promoting loose coupling, and facilitating easier testing, maintenance, and scalability.
